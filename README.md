# Sign-Recognition Model

This Sign-Recognition Model is a machine learning project built with Keras and TensorFlow. It employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to build a strong recognition system capable of recognising 10 different hand gestures in real time. The model can do live identification and display the name of the recognised gesture on the screen by accessing the webcam of the user's device. The model has been trained on a database of 10 getsures containing 500+ images each.

Features:
* Real-time recognition of hand gestures.
* Built using Python with Keras and TensorFlow.
* Utilizes the webcam to capture and process live video for gesture recognition.
* Capable of identifying and displaying the names of 10 different hand gestures.

Tools and Technologies:
* Keras and TensorFlow for building the CNN model.
* Python for implementing the project.
* Google Colab and PyCharm used as the Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) during development.
